The files that will need to be edited or added to satisfy the request are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to create the logo generation instruction file.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
